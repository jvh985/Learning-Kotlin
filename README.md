# Learning Kotlin and Intellij IDE

This project will be focused on getting used to the syntax of Kotlin and familiarizing
myself with the Intellij IDE w/ git

## If you are having trouble with Intellij defaulting to 'Master' Branch instead of 'Main'

Initialize git in the file directory of the project:
- start a new project but do not check the create repository option
- when you are ready to load your progress to GitHub, navigate to project folder in terminal
>git init
>
>git add . 
>
>git commit -m "your commit message"
> 
>git branch -M main
> 
> git remote add origin 'your repository url'
> 
> git push -u origin main

After this your 'Main' branch will show in Intellij version control
